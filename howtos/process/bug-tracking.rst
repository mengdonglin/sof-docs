Bug Tracking
############################
Bug type of issues have a label |label-bug|.

GitHub issues only have 2 states: open, closed. So *labels* are defined
to assist SOF bug tracking.

Life Cycle of a Bug
*********************
The life cycle of a bug is also the workflow for bugs. Here is a graphic
representation of this life cycle.

Labels
********
Please find the labels from https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/labels.

* *Solution*, *priority* and *platform* labels are common for SOF
  firmware, linux kernel driver and tool repositories.

* *Branch* labels are repository-specific.

Solution Labels
----------------
Usually a developer will fix a bug by submitting pull requests. This
is the default solution and so doesn't any solution label.

Otherwise, **developers** need to add a label |label-invalid|,
|label-duplicate| or |label-won't-fix| to indicate the solution with
justication.

        :scale: 70

.. |label-won't-fix| image:: images/label-will-not-fix.png
        :scale: 70

Label |label-verified| is only added by the **bug scrub owner** after
reviewing the solution and feedback from QA and bug reporter.

Priority Labels
-----------------
**Bug scrub owner** should use them to set priority to a bug according
to its impact.

Plaform and Branch Labels
----------------------------
Used by **QA** and **bug reporter**.

*Platform* labels are used to specify a platform or multiple platforms on
which a bug is observed, e.g. |label-byt|, |label-apl|, |label-glk| ...

.. |label-byt| image:: images/label-platform-byt.png
        :scale: 70

.. |label-apl| image:: images/label-platform-apl.png
        :scale: 70

.. |label-glk| image:: images/label-platform-glk.png
        :scale: 70

*Branch* labels are used specify a branch or multiple branches on which
a bug is observed, e.g. |label-branch-v1.2|, |label-branch-glk|,
|label-branch-master| ...


.. |label-branch-v1.2| image:: images/label-branch-v1-2.png
        :scale: 70

.. |label-branch-glk| image:: images/label-branch-glk.png
        :scale: 70

.. |label-branch-master| image:: images/label-branch-master.png
        :scale: 70

.. note::
    *Platform* labels should always be applied.

    *Branch* labels are usually only applied when the branch is not
    the default branch for developing/release on the platform.

    **QA** should *update (add/remove)* platform and branch labels
    according to the latest bug status.

Other optional Labels
-----------------------

Two optional labels can be used to call for attention.

* |label-blocked| - Blocked by some dependency, whichh applies to either
  feature implementation or bug reproduction.

* |label-need-info| - Further information is requested.

How to Report a Bug
********************
Please
`create a issue <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/>`_
and add label |label-bug|.

And please provide the following information:

* Title
     * The title should be a clear and concise summary of the bug.

     * The title must be unique and descriptive. Bad examples are
       "ipc timeout" and "topology failed to load". Ideally the title
       should contain keywords from the kernel, firmware, or user space
       error message.

     * The title should also contain a prefix indicating the area of
       failure e.g. "ipc:", "topology:", "pipeline:"

* Environment
    * Branch name and commit hash of 3 repositories: sof (firmware),
      linux (kernel driver) and soft (tools & topology).

    * Name of the topology file

    * Name of the platform(s) on which the bug is observed.

    * Reproducibility Rate. If you can only reproduce it randomly,
      it's useful to report how many times the bug has been reproduced
      vs. the number of attempts itâ€™s taken to reproduce the bug.

* Steps to reproduce
   * The steps must be precise. And please help to narrow down the steps.

   * Please number the steps from beginning to end so developers can
     easily follow through by repeating the same process

* Expected Result
   * Describe what the user should expect.

* Actual Result
   * In contrast to the expected behavior, describe what currently happens.

* Proof
    * Please paste the relevant dmesg and logger data to the comment box.
      The pasted data should contain the actual crash or error but also
      the conditions prior to the bug. i.e. also copy the 10 lines before
      the crash

    * Entire kernel message and firmware logger text should also be
      attached for reference.

    * For audio quality issues, it's helpful to play a sine wav and
      attach the captured waveform.

.. note::
    If you have multiple issues, please file them separately so they can
    be tracked more easily.

    Please use `markdown <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`_
    for formatting example commands, code, diffs, patches etc.

How to Close a Bug
********************

* For bugs fixed by pull requests

    *Developers* can use
    `keywords <https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/>`_
    close one or multiple bugs via pull requests automatically.

    *Developers* can also leave the bug open, and *QA* should close the
    bug if it cannot be reproduced after verification.

.. note::
    After the pull request(s) is merged, *developer* should always
    **@QA** to verify the solution.


* For bugs with label |label-invalid| or |label-won't-fix|,
  *develpers* should close them with justification.

* For bugs with label |label-duplicate|,
  please keep the bug open until its duplicate is resolved and closed.
